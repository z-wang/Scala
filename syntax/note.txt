1. if - else
def abs(x : Int) = if (x>=0) x else -x

2. when defined a val, do calculation when you assign the value
def loop:Boolean = loop
THIS IS OK => def x = loop  -> build another reference to this function
THIS IS NOT OK => val x = loop  -> will value loop when assign

3. call by name vs call by value
#call by value will do calculation when you assign the value
CBN: def xx(x: Boolean, y: => Boolean)
CBY: def xx(x: Boolean, y: Boolean)

4.
